## General Information

Environment variables are used in this code repository to control how the application builds, how and where data is fetched for separate sections in the application, for rendering certain features, and for controlling data flow.

General environment variables are declared in the `.env-sample` file. A copy of this file should be made and saved as `.env` where real values should be added. In the application, the `.env` file is read and all variables are loaded in the main `index.js` file.

Generally, environment variables are meant to be read through the `process.env` object _on the server_. In order to pass these variables to the client where some of these variables are used, Webpack is used to define and bundle certain variables. This is done through the `DefinePlugin` Webpack plugin found in the `webpack.config.js` file. Most of these variables are used in `src/app/data/appConfig.js` for application-wide configuration.

If an environment variable is updated, make sure to restart the server for the application to pick up the new value.

## Server and Application-wide Variables

These variables are used to configure server settings and application-wide settings.

| Variable | Type | Value Example | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `APP_ENV` | string | `production`, `development` | The environment variable checked in the NYPL Header, but also used in the `DrbbContainer` component.
| `BASE_URL` | string | `/research/research-catalog` | The base URL for the application. |
| `BUNDLE_ANALYZER` | boolean | true, false | Whether or not to run the `webpack-visualizer-plugin` plugin in webpack. |
| `DISPLAY_TITLE` | string | "Research Catalog" | The title of the application displayed throughout the UI. |
| `LEGACY_BASE_URL` | string | "" | The base url for the legacy catalog. |
| `NODE_ENV` | string | `development`, `test`, `production` | The environment in which the application is running. When running `npm test`, the value is `test`. When running locally, the default is `development` but it should be `production` for the "production" build and server. |
| `REDIRECT_FROM_BASE_URL` | string | "/research/collections/shared-collection-catalog" | The old base URL of the app. If a user goes to the old URL, the server redirects the user. |
| `WEBPAC_BASE_URL` | string | "" | The base URL for the webpac catalog. |
| `TZ` | string | "America/New_york" | May be set to "America/New_York" to ensure pickup time estimates are calculated using the correct offset from GMT (accounting for Daylight Savings). May not be necessary on laptops/servers already configured to use an equivalent timezone. (If in doubt, check via `date`.). <br /><br />The `TZ` var is special in that it may not work if set dynamically in application code due to the indirect relationship of the env var and the underlying time system. It should work consistently when set outside the application (i.e. by the process that creates the Node process). For example `TZ=America/New_York node -e 'console.log((new Date()).getTimezoneOffset())'` should consistently report the correct minute offset for the time of year (240 in EDT, 300 in EST). |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | string | "" | AWS credential value created from AWS IAM account. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | string | "" | AWS credential value created from AWS IAM account. |

## Application Variables

These environment variables control how certain elements on the page render and where to fetch data.

## Testing

When tests are run through the `npm test` command, the setup configuration file at `/test/helpers/browser.js` reads environment variables from the `test.env` file.

## Encrypted Variables

As previously mentioned in the [README](README.md), we are using environment variables to make authorized requests to NYPL's API platform. In order to be secure, we are encrypting and decrypting those environment variables using AWS KMS. Please get these variables from someone in the NYPL Digital Department.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `PLATFORM_API_CLIENT_ID` | Platform client id. If KMS_ENV is "encrypted", this value must be encrypted. |
| `PLATFORM_API_CLIENT_SECRET` | Platform client secret. If KMS_ENV is "encrypted", this value must be encrypted. |

### Encrypting

Two variables are assumed encrypted when `KMS_ENV` is "encrypted": `PLATFORM_API_CLIENT_ID` and `PLATFORM_API_CLIENT_SECRET`. We need these variables to create an instance of the `nypl-data-api-client` npm package and make authorized requests to the NYPL Digital API endpoints. This is needed for the Discovery UI app to make requests itself to the APIs.

In order to encrypt, please use the `aws` [cli tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). The command to encrypt is

    aws kms encrypt --key-id [your IAM key from AWS] --plaintext [value to encrypt] --output text --query CiphertextBlob

The `aws kms encrypt` commands returns and object with a `CiphertextBlob` property. Since we only want that value, we use the `--query` flag to retrieve just that. This value can be copied and pasted into the AWS EBS configuration in the UI for the app's environment.

More information can be found in the [encrypt docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/encrypt.html).

NOTE: This value is base64 encoded, so when decoding make sure to decode using base64.

### Decrypting

In order to decrypt, we are using the `aws-sdk` npm module. Please check the [nyplApiClient](src/server/routes/nyplApiClient/index.js) file for more information and implementation on decryption.
